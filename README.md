Very simple bot I use to query the availability of my sever users for our DND campaign. This bot will create messages and react with a ✅, ❌, or ❓ so that users can choose what choice fits best for them

# commands

### !react a, b, c...

Sends a message for every choice and reacts with the above emojis.
example: !react Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Spaces after "," are optional

### !reactq question? a, b, c...

First sends the question to the chat, then sends a message for every choice and reacts with the above emojis.
example: !reactq What days are you all available? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
The "? " is required
Spaces after "," are optional

### !clear

Clears all bot messages (limit 100)
