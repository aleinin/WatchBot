Very simple bot I use to query the availability of my sever users for our D&D campaign. This bot will create messages and react with a ✅, ❌, or ❓ so that users can choose what choice fits best for them

# commands

### !react a, b, c...

Sends a message for every choice and reacts with the above emojis. <br /><br />
example: !react Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday <br />
Spaces after "," are optional 

### !reactq question? a, b, c...

First sends the question to the chat, then sends a message for every choice and reacts with the above emojis. <br />
example: !reactq What days are you all available? Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday <br />
The "? " is required <br />
Spaces after "," are optional 

### !clear

Clears all bot messages (limit 100)
